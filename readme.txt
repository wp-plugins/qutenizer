== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why my image doesn't work? =

Choosing light colors makes it difficult for code-readers to detect the generated image. We encourage you to test the images before any public use.
Testing the generated images on computer screens usually leads to worse performance than printed ones.

= How can I generate and download images? =

QutenizeR images generated in posts (or pages) are automatically uploaded to the Media Library as attachments to the selected page or post.
The text field is automatically extracted from the given post/page permalink url. Don't forget to regenerate your images after permalinks changes.

Images created from QutenizeR management page (under 'Settings') are stored under 'qutenizer/generated' folder in the plugins folder. 
Text field is not restricted here. You can easely download the images by right-clicking and selecting 'Save as..' on your web browser.

= Fresh new generated imaged from edit post or page doesn't appear in Media Library  =

If the image has been correctly generated and the ok message has appeared, you may need to force the Media Library to reload itself by performing some action on it, otherwise, refresh the whole page from your browser.

= Why our link on the image? =

QutenizeR.com (http://qutenizer.com) is a free online Web service. The generated images are ready to use, but they can also be modified to get the final result you deserve.
If the 'www.QutenizeR.com' text line doesn't fit into your proyect, a mention about us would be welcome.
